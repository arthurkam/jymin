Jymin is "JavaScript You Minify", meaning Jymin scripts get concatenated with
your application code and minfied within a single function closure. Functions
your application uses will remain intact after minification, and functions you
don't use will drop out. The end result is that browsers will download and run
your code quickly, enabling the most responsive experiences possible.
